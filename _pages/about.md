I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the lab of Prof Kun-Hsing Yu in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Previously, I completed my PhD in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology at MIT under the guidance of Prof Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer. From 2023 to 2024, I was a Research Fellow in the Department of Data Science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. I also hold an MD from Heidelberg University Medical School and a BS in Physics with a minor in Computer Science from Kiel University in Germany.

My research focuses on developing AI methods that are clinically meaningful, robust, and aligned with real-world healthcare workflows. I am particularly interested in combining technical innovation with domain expertise so that models can support clinicians and improve patient outcomes.

## Research Areas

I am currently building a research program around three connected themes:

1. **Disease modeling from complex clinical and molecular data**  
   Building machine learning models that can represent biological and clinical heterogeneity in diseases such as cancer.
2. **Interpretability and trust in medical AI**  
   Designing methods that help clinicians understand model behavior and identify when predictions are reliable.
3. **Translation to healthcare practice**  
   Creating AI systems that are tailored to clinical needs, fit existing workflows, and can be evaluated for practical impact.

*Detailed research pages are in development and will be added here soon.*
