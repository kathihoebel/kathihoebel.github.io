I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Data Science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute & Harvard Medical School. Previously, I completed my PhD in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology at MIT under the guidance of Prof Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer. I also hold an MD from Heidelberg University Medical School and a BS in Physics with a minor in Computer Science from Kiel University in Germany.
 
My research is centered on developing AI models that cater to the specific needs of our healthcare systems. I firmly believe that making a meaningful impact on healthcare providers and patients, requires the development of models guided by domain expertise and a user-centered approach. 
 
Currently, my primary focus lies in leveraging the capabilities of ML models to emulate complex patterns within medical data. Drawing inspiration from work in drug discovery and interpretability, I aim to employ these models to enhance our understanding of complex diseases such as cancer.
